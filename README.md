### Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update config as you need.

```
WWW_PORT=3310
API_PORT=3311
MEDIA_PORT=3312
ADMINER_PORT=3313
SOLR_PORT=8983

TRACE_IMPORT_MODE=false # Bulk import mode

NEXT_PUBLIC_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3311    # external URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDIA_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3312  # external URL

WATCH_DIR=trace.moe-incoming/  # suggest using fast drives
MEDIA_DIR=trace.moe-media/     # suggest using large drives
HASH_DIR=trace.moe-hash/       # suggest using fast drives
SOLR_DIR=mycores               # suggest using super fast drives
MYSQL_DIR=mysql

TRACE_MEDIA_SALT=YOUR_TRACE_MEDIA_SALT
TRACE_API_SALT=YOUR_TRACE_API_SALT
TRACE_API_SECRET=YOUR_TRACE_API_SECRET
MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=YOUR_MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD
```

2. If you are installing it on Linux, ensure the directories are created and empty before starting the containers. The `SOLR_DIR`, must have it's owner `uid` and `gid` set to `8983`.

```bash
mkdir -p trace.moe-incoming/
mkdir -p trace.moe-media/
mkdir -p trace.moe-hash/
mkdir -p mycores
mkdir -p mysql
sudo chown 8983:8983 mycores
```

### Starting the cluster

```bash
docker-compose up -d --force-recreate
```

### Importing media files

Media files will be imported when placed into the incoming folder (`trace.moe-incoming`).

The files must be contained in 1-level folders, e.g.

```
trace.moe-incoming/foo.mp4  <= not ok
trace.moe-incoming/1/foo.mp4 <= ok
trace.moe-incoming/1/bar/foo.mp4 <= ok, but will be uploaded as /1/foo.mp4
```

trace.moe assumes the folder name is anilist ID. If your data is not related to anilist ID, you can use any id/text you want. The system would still work without anilist data.

Files must have the `.mp4` extension and must be in the mp4 format inorder to be imported, other files will be ignored.

Do not create the folders in the incoming directory. You should first put video files in folders, then move or copy the folders into the incoming directory.

Once the video files are in incoming directory, the watcher would start uploading the video to trace.moe-media. When it's done, it would delete the video in incoming directory. After Hash worker and Load workers complete the job, you can search the video by image in your www website at WWW_PORT.

### Bulk import mode

It is possible to import data in bulk. When the application is started with `TRACE_IMPORT_MODE` set to `true`, it will disable search, rate limiting of API requests and auto commiting when the loader submits media to Solr. This is done so the internal systems go as fast as possible.
The default value is `false`.

When you are finished importing. Make sure you commit your files in your Solr cluster(s) before you turn it off. This can be done by manually visiting the update commit for your cluster(s). The default is: `http://localhost:8983/solr/cl_0/update?commit=true`. It might take a while for the cluster to fully process the imported documents.
